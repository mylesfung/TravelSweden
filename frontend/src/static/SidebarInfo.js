  with modern innovation. The region’s fertile farmland and proximity to the sea mean local produce 
  and fresh seafood are central to the dining scene. In Malmö, visitors can find a vibrant international

export function History() {

  const body_text = `Skåne has a rich and layered history, shaped by its strategic location 
  at the crossroads of Scandinavia and continental Europe. Once part of Denmark until the 
  mid-17th century, the region retains cultural influences from both sides of the Öresund 
  Strait. The Treaty of Roskilde (1658) transferred Skåne to Swedish control, but Danish 
  heritage remains evident in language, traditions, and architecture. Lund, one of the oldest 
  cities in Sweden, was founded in the 10th century and is home to the famous Lund Cathedral, 
  a Romanesque masterpiece dating back to the 1100s. Helsingborg, another historic city, 
  features Kärnan, a medieval tower that once formed part of a larger castle defending the 
  Danish crown. In the countryside, Skåne’s historic estates and castles—such as Sofiero 
  alace, Övedskloster, and Glimmingehus, a well-preserved medieval fortress—offer insight 
  into the region’s aristocratic past. The area is also dotted with prehistoric sites, 
  including Bronze Age burial mounds and stone circles. During the 19th and 20th centuries, 
  Skåne played an important role in agriculture and industry, which shaped its modern identity.
  Today, the region celebrates its history through museums, 
  restored landmarks, and cultural festivals that blend Swedish and Danish traditions.`;

  const body_text = `Skåne has emerged as a hub for design and innovation in Sweden, with Malmö 
  leading the way as a center for architecture, sustainability, and creative industries. 
  The city’s skyline is defined by the Turning Torso, a striking residential tower designed 
  by Santiago Calatrava, which symbolizes modern Scandinavian design principles: functionality, 
  minimalism, and integration with the environment. Beyond architecture, Skåne has cultivated a 
  thriving design culture through its universities, particularly Lund University, which fosters 
  innovation in product design, engineering, and technology. Malmö’s creative districts, such as
   Möllevången and Västra Hamnen, are home to startups, design studios, and co-working spaces that
    merge design with sustainability. The region also emphasizes eco-friendly solutions, with a 
    focus on renewable energy, green urban planning, and circular economy models. In product design,
     local companies produce furniture, textiles, and household goods that reflect the clean, 
     functional aesthetic for which Scandinavian design is known. Skåne’s design innovation is not 
     limited to big cities—craft traditions in ceramics, glass, and textiles continue in smaller 
     towns, where artisans reinterpret traditional methods for modern use. Together, these elements
     make Skåne a region where heritage and forward-thinking design coexist in unique harmony.`;
